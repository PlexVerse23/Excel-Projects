## 📍 Project 1: Data Analyst Job Market Analysis

This project analyzes over 10,000 real job listings to understand salary distribution, regional pay gaps, and top-demanded skills in the data analytics job market. The goal was to simulate a professional report you'd deliver to a job market analyst or HR strategist.

This project is divided into two parts — in the first part, I created an interactive Excel dashboard that highlights key job market metrics and allows users to filter values using data validation tools. The second part dives deeper into the analysis, exploring how different data skills influence the median salary across various job roles and regions, using tools like Power Query, PivotTables, and DAX.

One of the key findings was the **clear salary advantage** for candidates with skills like Python, SQL, and experience with cloud technologies like AWS. The analysis also explored salary differences by country and number of required skills.
